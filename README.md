This repository is an interactive robotic drawing installation for Kids at Autodesk Day 2017, by [@nonoesp](https://github.com/nonoesp) and [@garciadelcastillo](https://github.com/garciadelcastillo). 

A touchscreen allows kids to draw their creations, and a series of scripts convert their designs to robotic instructions.



The project is built with [Processing](https://processing.org/), [Dynamo](http://dynamobim.org/) and [Machina](https://github.com/garciadelcastillo/Machina) for [Dynamo](https://github.com/garciadelcastillo/Machina-Dynamo).

## Setup

If you want to try this at home (or probably better, your robot-enabled shop), please do the following:

- Install [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [Dynamo Studio](http://dynamobim.org/) in your Windows machine. 

- Inside of Dynamo, you should install two packages from the Package Manager. Go to `Packages > Search for a package...` and install `JsonData` and `Machina`. If at the time of this reading the packages have updated and broken some functionality, you can find copies of the working packages with this project in the folder `01_dynamo_packages`.

- Go to `02_processing_sketch` and open it with Processing. When you run it, you should see a full screen window where you can draw with your fingers or mouse. It also has some buttons that allow you to start a new drawing, undo some actions or export the current drawing. As you hit `Export`, two `.json` and `.jpg` files will be saved to the `data` folder in the sketch with the bitmap drawing and the json representation of the strokes. 

- Go to `03_dynamo_script` and open the Dynamo file with Dynamo Studio. On the far left of the screen, there is a code block with drawing parameters that you can customize based on your screen resolution, paper dimensions, location and orientation of the paper in robot world coordinates, and some speed settings.

- Once the settings are customized, load the `.json` file exported by Processing into the script with the `File Path` loader. If everything goes well, you should see planes representing the planes of your drawing in the 3D view. If that is the case, a `.prg` file will be saved to the dynamo script folder with the offline program that can be loaded in the robot controller and ran to draw the strokes ;)

The installation has been designed and tested for an ABB IRB 120 robot, but ideally, with small changes in the [Machina](https://github.com/garciadelcastillo/Machina) script, it could be used for Kuka, Universal Robots, GCode, etc.

Have fun!
